1. A typical problem in our work at CardinalHire involves the processing of user input, which is often noisy, and often a string or array.

With the language of your choice, given two integer arrays (A and B), how would you sort and merge B into A as one sorted array?
```
-	I 
```

Note: You may assume that A has enough space to hold additional elements from B, and the number of elements initialized in A and B are M and N, respectively.

2. If, instead, the two arrays A and B are string arrays, with the language of your choice, how would you sort and merge B into A as one sorted array? Does your approach change?

Note: Same assumptions as above.

3. You are given a linked list and a value: k. Find the kth element from the last.

Note: Same assumptions as above.
